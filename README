# denoscan

That name probably won't stick :)

This is a fairly trivial static analysis tool that is built with TypeScript and Deno (as opposed to Node.js for the uninitiated.) This started about eight months ago as a Node JavaScript pet project, then went through a few identities (Rust and Go for starters) and two parsing tools (ANTLR4 and tree-sitter.)

This particular set of cobbled together functionality is what remained when the dust settled. Many languages and frameworks enter, only one [stack of them] leaves as my old Auntie Entity used to say. Sort of. Not really.
